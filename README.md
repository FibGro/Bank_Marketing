# Bank Marketing

This project is part of the “learn by building” classification II section. The objectives are to find what variables are important for obtaining a subscriber and to create a model that can correctly predict a potential client’s preference towards the term deposit (product). The models are created by using Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Random Forest method.
